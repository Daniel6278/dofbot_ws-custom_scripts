=== Object Detection Cycle ===

Step 1: Positioning robot...
Moving to optimal viewing position...
Moving arm joints...
Current state before movement: {1: 90, 2: 160, 3: 20, 4: 0, 5: 89, 6: 5}
Target angles: [90, 100, 10, 0, 89, 5]
Moving wrist and gripper...
Current state before movement: {1: 89, 2: 100, 3: 11, 4: 0, 5: 89, 6: 5}
Target angles: [89, 100, 11, 0, 90, 5]
Robot positioned for object detection

Step 2: Taking photo...
Taking photo for object detection...
Initializing camera...
