=== Object Detection Cycle ===

Step 1: Positioning robot...
Moving to optimal viewing position...
Moving arm joints...
Current state before movement: {1: 90, 2: 163, 3: 16, 4: 0, 5: 89, 6: 6}
Target angles: [90, 100, 10, 0, 89, 6]
Moving wrist and gripper...
Current state before movement: {1: 107, 2: 100, 3: 10, 4: 0, 5: 89, 6: 5}
Target angles: [107, 100, 10, 0, 90, 5]
Robot positioned for object detection

Step 2: Taking photo...
